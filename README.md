## About Me

## 🛠 Current Projects

### Svelte

I'm passionate about Svelte.

* **[Portfolio Blog – Svelte Website](https://github.com/jollymick90/jolly-cv-blog)**
  I'm learning full‑stack web technologies (SSR and SSG) by designing and implementing my portfolio website.
  This site will be the starting point for projects, designs, personal opinions, and more.

* **[Dynamic Presentation Web App](https://github.com/jollymick90/svelte-presentation)**
  For my tech talks, I'm developing a web app to showcase upcoming presentations.

### Three.js

#### Space Gift Secret Santa

I created this web app to share the project with my hackathon teammates as a Secret Santa gift. With my college team, I participated in the NASA Space Apps Challenge in October 2024. At the end of the year, I wanted to create a memento of the project, so I merged all the web components and ported the Unity game to Three.js—all done without a front‑end framework.

## 🏆 Hackathons

### Space Apps Challenge

Our goal is to make astronauts' workouts less boring!
To achieve this, we're developing a series of mini‑games that can be integrated with training equipment like treadmills and rowers, focusing on engaging different body parts—especially the hands and head. We launched with three mini‑games: **Space Jogger**, **Astray**, and **Star Float**. I built **Star Float**.

We joined this challenge to help protect "Made in Italy" products from counterfeiting by developing an app featuring multiple interfaces.
